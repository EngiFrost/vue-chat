## Summary

The project uses vue-socket.io lib and doesn't work at all (vue-socket.io sucks, no connection). 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
